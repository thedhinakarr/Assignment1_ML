# Problem Description

## Question 1: Gradient Descent Implementation

### Function Definition
Consider the following function with two parameters:
f(x, y) = x² + y² + x(y + 2) + cos(3x)

### Requirements
a) Take the derivative of the function with respect to x
b) Take the derivative of the function with respect to y
c) Implement and use gradient descent and find the minimum of this function using Python
d) Plot the gradient descent results

### Submission Requirements
- Include all solutions in your report
- Implementation should be submitted separately
- The assignment is graded with U or G
